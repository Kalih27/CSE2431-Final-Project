## Group Members:
### Jiaqian Huang
### Andrew Maloney
### Alec Wilson

## Files
### RRScheduling.c, SJFScheduling.c, Makefile, runLogger, logger.c, proclog.c

## Requirements:
1. Make sure you have installed:
	$ sudo apt-get install build-essential
      
## How to run it
1. $ runLogger
    This will help compile the logger.c file and then run ./logger
2. You will be asked whether the process should be logged. If not the output will be showed in the terminal directly.
2. Will be asked for the rate at which the process will poll the proc folder (20 to 999 ms).
3. Input the proc id for which the length of next CPU burst will be calculated (You can get this from the list of process ids in terminal with help of some command lines.).
4. Get a log.txt file to store the actual length of next 10 CPU burst.
5. Choose to continue executing the programming or quit
